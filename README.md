# TTM Squeeze Momentum MT5 ReadMe File

## Product Description
This code is designed to accurately identify market consolidation periods and predict the onset of explosive market movements using the TTM Squeeze Momentum MT5 indicator developed by John Carter. The code utilizes various technical indicators such as linear regression, Bollinger Bands, and Keltner Bands to determine market volatility and price levels. Red dots are displayed on the middle line to signify market consolidation phases, while the code accurately predicts the start of explosive market movements.

## Code Details
The code consists of several indicator functions that are used to calculate the TTM Squeeze Momentum MT5 indicator, as well as the supporting indicators such as linear regression, Bollinger Bands, and Keltner Bands. Here is a breakdown of the code structure:

### Indicator Variables
- `ttm_Squeeze[]`: Stores the values of the TTM Squeeze Momentum MT5 indicator.
- `linear_regression[]`: Stores the values of the linear regression indicator.
- `bollinger_bands[]`: Stores the values of the Bollinger Bands indicator.
- `keltner_bands[]`: Stores the values of the Keltner Bands indicator.

### Thresholds
- `consolidation_threshold`: Defines the threshold for market consolidation. Default value is 0.01.
- `explosive_movement_threshold`: Defines the threshold for explosive market movements. Default value is 0.02.

### Initialization
The `OnInit()` function initializes the indicator buffers, sets indicator labels and parameters, and returns the initialization status.

### Calculation
The `OnCalculate()` function is called to calculate the indicators based on the provided price data. It calls the necessary indicator functions and returns the number of calculated bars.

### Indicator Functions
- `TTM_Squeeze_Momentum_MT5()`: Calculates the TTM Squeeze Momentum MT5 indicator values based on the provided price data. It performs the logic to identify consolidation phases, display red dots on the middle line, and predict the start of explosive market movements.
- `Linear_Regression()`: Calculates the linear regression indicator values based on the provided closing prices.
- `Bollinger_Bands()`: Calculates the Bollinger Bands indicator values based on the provided closing prices.
- `Keltner_Bands()`: Calculates the Keltner Bands indicator values based on the provided closing prices.

Please refer to the individual indicator functions for detailed explanations of their calculation logic.
